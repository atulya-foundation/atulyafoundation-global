                            <p class="intro">The youngest of four children, Mark Rothko was born in Dvinsk, Russia in 1903 . In 1910,
                                his father, who was a pharmacist, died. Mark was just an eleven year old boy then. A lost
                                childhood left him sour as he was left with no choice but to start working at such a young
                                age. He began to deliver groceries and sold newspapers after school. Luckily ,as he grew
                                up, he was awarded a scholarship to Yale University, but he soon found the environment
                                at Yale conservative and exclusionary and left without graduating soon after. In January
                                1924, Rothko enrolled at the Art Students League and began taking anatomy courses. He
                                also joined an acting company and although his career in the theatre was short-lived, his
                                interest continued. Rothko’s love for the theatre informed his works throughout his life; he
                                painted theatrical scenes, admired many playwrights, and referred to his paintings as
                                “drama”, and his forms as “performers”. His most famous compositions contain multiple
                                soft-edged blocks of colours which seem to float in space called “multi-forms” and yes,
                                nothing else. No other figures at all.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p class="intro">“Pictures must be miraculous.”<br>
                                    – Mark Rothko</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p class="intro mt-40">Rothko first developed this compositional strategy in 1947. Described as “Colour Field painting” —a term that stuck —it is a style characterised by significant open space and an expressive use of colours. Rothko was one of its pioneers. “His coloured rectangles seemed to dematerialise into pure light. These are some of his paintings from the early fifties:</p>
                            <p class="intro mt-40">Rothko spent the rest of his career exploring the limitless possibilities of layering variously sized and colored rectangles onto fields of color. As the style developed, Rothko’s paintings grew much larger, something the artist believed created “a state of intimacy.” “A large picture is an immediate transaction,” he said. “It takes you into it. He wanted to remove all obstacles between the painter, the painting and the viewer. His paintings were meant to entirely engulf the viewer and pull the viewer out of the mechanized, commercial society over which artists like Rothko despaired. In his own words: </p>
                            <p class="intro mt-40">He was always somewhat of an advocate .In particular he supported artists’ total freedom of expression, which he felt was compromised by the market. This belief often put him at odds with the art world establishment, leading him to publicly respond to critics, and ccasionally refuse commissions, sales and exhibitions.</p>
                            <p class="intro mt-40">Rothko wrote the manuscript for a book which was to be called The Artist’s Reality. However, it was never published in his lifetime, being hidden away for over fifty years. These writings discuss Rothko’s ideas about Modern art, myth, beauty, the nature of American art, and the challenges of being an artist in his society.</p>
                            <p class="intro mt-40">By 1968, Rothko’s health was in decline from years of severe anxiety and his related drinking and smoking habits. After surviving an aneurism, he continued to smoke and drink despite his doctor’s orders, but he did scale back the size of his canvases and switch from oils to acrylic paints to reduce the strain that his painting process placed on his body.</p>
                            <p class="intro mt-40">To visitors he explained that because of his heart condition he was not allowed to lift heavy canvases, and thus he had resorted to working on paper. His paintings got noticeably darker, some people tried to relate that to his mental state of depression, it ultimately culminated in Suicide.</p>
