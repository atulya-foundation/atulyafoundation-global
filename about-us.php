                        <p class="intro">Atulya foundation is a not for profit organization working for the welfare of the artist community in India. We believe that art can only
                            be preserved when the artists get incentives, both monetary and social, to remain artists and these incentive can only be brought to them when art is a
                            viable means of livelihood. Many talented artists are in a state of dire poverty today and are turning to other jobs to sustain themselves. Hence we
                            bring in our professional expertise to convert artwork into products and services so as to monetize art in the best way possible. Our not-for profit
                            model ensures that the benefits reach completely and directly to the artist.

                        <p>Art is the most beautiful manifestation of human creativity. World is a home to numerous traditional & modern art forms. This rich heritage of art needs
                            to be preserved. Inadequate incentive and livelihood is forcing artists to abandon art and look for other jobs. </p>
                        <p>In the pressure to earn a decent living, many potential artists do not even dare to pursue arts and crafts as a career and traditional artists with their
                            conventional methods fail to capitalise on their skills and limited resources to generate enough money to even feed their families. </p>
                        <p>This is where the ‘Atulya’ Idea is born: Making Art a Sustained Means of Livelihood</p>
                        <p>Atulya foundation is a family of artists and art enthusiasts. We leverage the internet technologies to make the art business more engaging, efficient and
                            lucrative and at the same time being secure and authentic. With billions of devices active on the internet, we have access to a massive customer base
                            that conventionally would have required a tremendous amount of manpower, capital and infrastructure.</p>
